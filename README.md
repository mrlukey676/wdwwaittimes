# Walt Disney World Wait Times Tool
## Introduction
This is a simple app that gives the average wait times for all Walt Disney World **rides**. Simply download the latest version .zip file from [here](https://github.com/mrlukey676/wdwwaittimes/releases), extract the zip to wherever and open the .exe file.
## How it works
Python libraries in use: [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter), [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter) and [OpenPyXl](https://foss.heptapod.net/openpyxl/openpyxl).
This is the first app I have made using CustomTkinter/Tkinter, so there may be some issues.
Using the xlsx file I have created, openpyxl searches the sheet for the attraction. Then, the average wait time is located in another column in the spreadsheet, so we just output that!
## User guide
Press the 'Open Dialog' button and input the attraction you wish to see the average wait for!
